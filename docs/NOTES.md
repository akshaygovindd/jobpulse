## 2026-11-09: Planning docs

**What changed**
- Added `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and this file. There is no application code, Terraform, or workflows yet.
- The plan went through two review rounds. Owner corrections in round 2:
  1. Added a $10/month AWS Budgets alert. It's an alert, not a cap.
  2. Separated the logical daily snapshot (source, company, date) from the execution attempt. Raw is append-only, there is one authoritative pointer per day, and downstream reads pointers only.
  3. OIDC trust is pinned to `repo:akshaygovindd/jobpulse:environment:prod`, and `prod` is restricted to `main`.
  4. Dropped the keepalive workflow. Inactivity is handled with a freshness alert and a manual recovery runbook instead.
  5. Removed the Standard-IA lifecycle transition.
  6. P1 writes ops data as JSON to S3. MotherDuck starts in P2.
  7. Dropped `tf_plan.yml`. The owner runs plan locally.
  8. The "2 consecutive scheduled days" criterion is tracked separately and doesn't block P2. P1 reports failed companies with reason codes.
  9. The five MVP pages (P5) are labeled separately from Resume Match (P6).
  10. The owner provides the seed employer list.
- Owner decisions:
  - Extraction uses Haiku 5.5 first and escalates to Sonnet 5.5, configured in YAML.
  - Region is us-east-1, with a bootstrap state bucket.
  - Cross-source duplicates get a flag column only.
  - CI includes gitleaks.
  - Hosting is Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Checks run**
- None needed. Only docs changed, and no code exists yet.

**Decisions after review**
- The budget alert uses direct email subscribers, not SNS. Because AWS Budgets direct email has no opt-in step, P1 verifies the subscriber in the console or with the CLI.
- Docs were committed on `docs/planning`, merged into `main`, and pushed. From now on, work happens directly on `main`.

**Open questions for owner**
- Waiting on the seed employer list to build `config/employers.yaml`.
